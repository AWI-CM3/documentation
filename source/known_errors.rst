  - **Situation**: This error likely appears when you restart the model after the previous leg did not finish successfully.
  - **Solution**: To fix it you need to substract NYEAR_awicm3 from INITIAL_DATE_awicm3. 
  - **Background**: The underlying reason is that AWICM3 currently contains a memory leak when the restart timesteps get large. As a stopgap measure the inital time is moved forward while the restart timestep is kept constant. When a run is started twice from the same restart time INITIAL_DATE_awicm3 is moved forward twice.
